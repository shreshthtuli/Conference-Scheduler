# AUTOMATED CONFERENCE SCHEDULER

## Goal: 
The goal of scheduler is to take a complex new problem and formulate and solve it as search. Formulation as search is an integral skill of AI that will come in handy whenever you are faced with a new problem. Heuristic search will allows us to find optimal solutions. Local search may not find the optimal solution, but is usually able to find good solutions for really large problems.
Scenario: Optimization of Conference Schedule.

A conference has n papers accepted. The job is to organize them in a best possible schedule. The schedule has p parallel sessions at a given time. Each session has k papers. And there are a total of t time slots. We can assume that n = t.p.k. For example, in Figure below t =2, p = 3 and k =4.

Papers 1,2,3,4     | Papers 5,6,7,8      |  Papers 9,10,11,12
Papers 13,14,15,16 | Papers 17,18,19,20  |  Papers 21,22,23,24

We first define the characteristics of a good schedule. For any good schedule most people should feel no conflict about which session to attend. That is, (1) all papers in one session should be related to a single theme. And (2) all papers in parallel sessions should be as far away as possible to avoid conflict.
To operationalize this intuition let us assume we are given a function representing the distance between two papers: d(p1,p2), such that d is between 0 and 1. We can similarly define a similarity between two papers s(p1,p2) = 1-d(p1,p2).
Now we can define the goodness of a schedule as follows:

Sum(similarities of all pairs of papers in a session) + C.Sum(distances of all pairs of papers in parallel sessions).

In our example, the goodness will be computed as
s(1,2) + s(1,3) + s(1,4) + s(2,3) + s(2,4) + s(3,4) + s(5,6) +s(5,7)+s(5,8)+s(6,7)+s(6,8)+s(7,8) +…….
+ C[d(1,5)+d(1,6)+…d(1,11)+d(1,12) + d(2,5) … + d(2,12) + ….. + d(8,12) + d(13,17)+…]

The constant C trades off the importance of semantic coherence of one session versus reducing conflict across parallel sessions.

Our goal is to find a schedule with the maximum goodness. 

## Input: 
The first line has total processing time available in minutes.
The second line has k: the number of papers per session
The third line has p: the number of parallel sessions
The fourth line has t: the number of time slots.
(This implies that number of papers is pkt)
The fifth line has C: the tradeoff parameter
Starting sixth line we have space separated list of distances between a paper and all others. Note that d(x,y) = d(y,x). Also, all d(x,x) = 0.
Here is a sample input

0 0.4 0.8 1
0.4 0 0.6 0.7
0.8 0.6 0 0.3
1 0.7 0.3 0

## Output:
The algorithm returns the max-goodness schedule found in the desired time limit.
The output format is: space separated list of paper ids, where a session is separated by bars. And all papers in a time slot in a different line.
For this problem above the optimal solution is p1 and p2 in one session; and p3-p4 in other. It will be represented as
0 1 | 2 3
Notice that there are other equivalent ways to represent this same solution. Example:
1 0 | 2 3 or 3 2 | 0 1 or 2 3 | 1 0 (etc). All of these are equally valid
It can be verified that for this problem the total goodness is 4.4.
